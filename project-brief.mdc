# HydroGPT - Complete Water Accessibility Analysis System

## Project Overview
Build a complete water accessibility analysis system for Mbeere South Subcounty, Kenya using SCM-G2SFCA methodology.

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend API working (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Database with shapefiles loaded (sublocations, waterpoints, homesteads)
- ✅ React frontend structure
- ❌ Map not displaying shapefiles properly
- ❌ Limited query responses
- ❌ Need comprehensive analysis capabilities

## Required Completions

### 1. Fix Interactive Map
- Display actual sublocation polygons from database
- Show water points as markers with capacity indicators
- Color-code areas by accessibility scores (Very Weak=red, Weak=orange, Good=lightblue, Very Good=darkblue)
- Add popup information on click
- Zoom to sublocation on query
- Show homestead points when requested

### 2. Comprehensive LLM Integration
- Answer ALL possible questions about water accessibility
- Generate insights from SCM-G2SFCA analysis
- Provide policy recommendations
- Compare sublocations intelligently
- Statistical analysis and summaries
- Methodology explanations

### 3. Advanced Query Capabilities
Handle queries like:
- "Show me Makima on the map"
- "Which areas need urgent intervention?"
- "Compare walking vs driving accessibility"
- "How many people have poor water access?"
- "What's the population-weighted average accessibility?"
- "Show water points by capacity"
- "Explain SCM-G2SFCA methodology"
- "What are the infrastructure gaps?"

### 4. Dynamic Chart Generation
- Bar charts for rankings
- Pie charts for category distribution
- Population impact analysis
- Mode-specific accessibility comparison
- Infrastructure gap analysis

### 5. Map Control Integration
LLM should control map based on queries:
- Highlight specific areas
- Filter water points
- Zoom to locations
- Change color schemes
- Show/hide layers

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Current tables in PostgreSQL
- sublocations (geometry, accessibility scores, population)
- waterpoints (geometry, capacity scores, types)
- homesteads (geometry, accessibility by mode)
- sublocation_statistics (pre-computed summaries)
