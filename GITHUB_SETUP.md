# 📦 Push HydroGPT to GitHub

## ✅ Repository is Ready!

Your HydroGPT project is now fully configured and committed to git. Here's how to push it to GitHub:

## 🔑 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository" or visit [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
3. **Repository name**: `hydrogpt` (or `HydroGPT-Water-Analysis`)
4. **Description**: `🌊 AI-powered water accessibility analysis for Mbeere South Subcounty using SCM-G2SFCA methodology`
5. Set to **Public** (recommended for showcasing)
6. **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 🚀 Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /home/elias/projects/Hydrogpt

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/hydrogpt.git

# Rename branch to main (modern convention)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username!**

## 🔐 Authentication Options

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token with `repo` permissions
3. Use token as password when prompted

### Option 2: SSH Key (Most Secure)
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key and add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Then use SSH URL: `git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/hydrogpt.git`
